This is an example React project for the [Speech To Element](https://www.npmjs.com/package/speech-to-element) library. The [Web Speech](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API) service option is preconfigured to work right out of the box, and the [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/speech-to-text) option will automatically retrieve a token from one of the [example servers](https://github.com/OvidijusParsiunas/speech-to-element/tree/main/examples).
